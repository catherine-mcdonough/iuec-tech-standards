# NHS Integrated Urgent Care Technical Standards



## Purpose

These standards outline technical, interoperability, and information requirements for systems and services operating within the English NHS Urgent Care system.

You can find the [Existing NHS 111 IM&T Standards here](nhs111_imt_standards/index.md). These were issued alongside the initial NHS 111 rollout and will gradually be replaced by the new guidance.
